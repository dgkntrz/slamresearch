## What is this repository?

This repository provides us a comparative study on various SLAM algorithms in terms of performance and accuracy.

## System

All the algorithms are tested under Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. Computer specifications are:

Graphics: GTX860M

Processor: Intel Core i7 4700HQ

Storage: Toshiba 1TB 5400 RPM HDD

## scripts

This folder consists of scripts I have used to refine the output files I get from the algorithms, since not all algorithms
provide us an output that would work on evaluation tool.

## output

This folder consists of all the converted output data I got from algorithms. 

## graphs

This folder consists of drawn graphs of the outputs, relative to the ground truth.
